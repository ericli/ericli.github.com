<p>Welcome to my new website! This is the second iteration of my personal website, with this version built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I’ll be using this blog to keep track of any notable projects or thoughts that I come up with in the future.</p>

<p>I would have preferred the domain <a href="https://ericli.com">“ericli.com”</a>, but the owners of the domain asked for a ludicrous $4000 dollars. Unfortunate.</p>
