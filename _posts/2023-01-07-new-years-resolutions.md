It's a new year, which also signifiies almost three years since I've updated this website. One of the things I wanted to do in the new year was to write more, and what better way to do it than write in a website that many people won't read. In the past year, I've felt like my ability to produce comprehensible text has waned to a deplorable state, so writing more will hopefully keep me on my A-game. If nothing nefarious happens to me, I at least would some partition of my writings to be comprehensible.

I wanted to start out with a list of new years resolutions to keep. I hopefully will hold myself to them. 

1. Read more. Looking back at the past year, I remember more of the hours that I spent reading than hours I spent staring at a screen. My current goal is to read the following list of books:
    1. Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace
    2. The Prive by Daniel Yergin
    3. Discourse on Livy by Niccolo Machievelli
    4. Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy
    5. The Idiot by Fyodor Dostoevsky
Ideally, this list will grow in the future, but I'll try to finish these books before starting something new. I would also like to read something technical/more related to my current career path

2. Run a half-marathon. As far as exercising goes, running is one of the most primitive yet most effective ways to get in better shape. A half-marathon seemed like a good set goal to have, but ideally I would run more consistently.

3. Have two arbitrary projects that are completed. I learned that there is no better way of learning something than doing, and there is a noticable lack of projects that I have worked on in recent times. 

4. Lastly, I hope to write more, ideally once a month inorder to save my comprehension skills. Reading may help me identify better writing, but I won't become a better writer unless I write more.
