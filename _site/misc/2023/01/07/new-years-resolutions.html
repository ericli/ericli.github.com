    <p>It’s a new year, which also signifiies almost three years since I’ve updated this website. One of the things I wanted to do in the new year was to write more, and what better way to do it than write in a website that many people won’t read. In the past year, I’ve felt like my ability to produce comprehensible text has waned to a deplorable state, so writing more will hopefully keep me on my A-game. If nothing nefarious happens to me, I at least would some partition of my writings to be comprehensible.</p>

<p>I wanted to start out with a list of new years resolutions to keep. I hopefully will hold myself to them.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Read more. Looking back at the past year, I remember more of the hours that I spent reading than hours I spent staring at a screen. My current goal is to read the following list of books:
    <ol>
      <li>Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace</li>
      <li>The Prive by Daniel Yergin</li>
      <li>Discourse on Livy by Niccolo Machievelli</li>
      <li>Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy</li>
      <li>The Idiot by Fyodor Dostoevsky
Ideally, this list will grow in the future, but I’ll try to finish these books before starting something new. I would also like to read something technical/more related to my current career path</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run a half-marathon. As far as exercising goes, running is one of the most primitive yet most effective ways to get in better shape. A half-marathon seemed like a good set goal to have, but ideally I would run more consistently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have two arbitrary projects that are completed. I learned that there is no better way of learning something than doing, and there is a noticable lack of projects that I have worked on in recent times.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Lastly, I hope to write more, ideally once a month inorder to save my comprehension skills. Reading may help me identify better writing, but I won’t become a better writer unless I write more.</li>
</ol>
