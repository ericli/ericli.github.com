One of the things I wanted to do in the new year was to write more, and what better way to do it than write in a website that many people won’t read. In the past year, I’ve felt like my ability to produce comprehensible text has waned to a deplorable state, so writing more will hopefully keep me on my A-game. If nothing nefarious happens to me, I at least would some partition of my writings to be comprehensible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to start out with a list of new years resolutions to keep. I hopefully will hold myself to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read more. Looking back at the past year, I remember more of the hours that I spent reading than hours I spent staring at a screen. My current goal is to read the following list of books:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The Prive by Daniel Yergin&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Discourse on Livy by Niccolo Machievelli&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The Idiot by Fyodor Dostoevsky
Ideally, this list will grow in the future, but I’ll try to finish these books before starting something new. I would also like to read something technical/more related to my current career path&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run a half-marathon. As far as exercising goes, running is one of the most primitive yet most effective ways to get in better shape. A half-marathon seemed like a good set goal to have, but ideally I would run more consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have two arbitrary projects that are completed. I learned that there is no better way of learning something than doing, and there is a noticable lack of projects that I have worked on in recent times.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lastly, I hope to write more, ideally once a month inorder to save my comprehension skills. Reading may help me identify better writing, but I won’t become a better writer unless I write more.&lt;/li&gt;
