I'm Eric, a software engineer at [C3 AI](https://www.c3.ai/). I am also a recent graduate of [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) where I got a B.S. in Mathematics and an additional major in Computer Science.

I'll use this website to write about things I find interesting, but that might change depending on who's eyes see this webpage.
