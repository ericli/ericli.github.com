I'm Eric, a Mathematics and Computer Science student at Carnegie Mellon University, expecting to graduate in May 2022. Currently, a lot of my time is spent on my coursework and reading about optimal execution and COVID-19 modeling. While this typically stands as a portfolio website, I'll talk about what's on my mind from time to time.
